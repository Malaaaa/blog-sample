# Generics

In languages like C# and Java, one of the main tools in the toolbox for creating reusable components is *generics*, that is, being able to create a component that can work over a variety of types rather than a single one. This allows users to consume these components and use their own types.[[Generics]([TypeScript: Documentation - Generics (typescriptlang.org)](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/generics.html))]

**Only generics can have a dynamic type.**
