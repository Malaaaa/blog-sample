## Background 

-  **(IoT) Current Status**
- Question **secure and efficient remote user authentication solution.**
- existing solutions **a single-server architecture**
- critical challenges **providing regulation of behaviors and privacy protection of access policy)**
- In this article **novel secure mutual authentication system** integrates blockchain

## Introduction

- home gateway **provides network access between local area network (LAN) hosts to a wide area network (WAN) (like the Internet) via a modem.** IP port
- remotely communicate can be targeted and subject to exploitation.
- The information from any single device may not be deemed sensitive
- remote authentication approaches.
  - password-based authentication. (limitations)
    1. Lack of Privacy and Anonymity
    2. Lack of Completeness and Confidentiality
  - One-time password (OTP) authentication 

- Remote user authentication schemes based on smart cards [11] have also been widely used in applications involving remote user login, Web access, and other online services, due to their efficiency, convenience, and low computational cost.
- blockchain-based authentications **a more secure, reliable and convenient IoT systems ** 
  - limitation : the user behaviors cannot be effectively regulated .
  - all the request transactions or access policy are in plaintext, which can be  collected to statistically analyze user daily life, and thus, compromising user privacy.
  - Contributions: To further provide traceability and privacy protection of access policy, we integrate both blockchain and group signature
  - Organization: organize the reminder of this article as follows. Section II reviews the current blockchain-based smart home systems.
